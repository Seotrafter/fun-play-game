                <h2>6. Cookie Management</h2>

                <h3>6.1 How to Control Cookies</h3>
                <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. Here's how you can manage cookies in the main browsers:</p>

                <h4>Google Chrome</h4>
                <p>Go to Settings > Privacy and security > Cookies and other site data > See all cookies and site data. From here you can block or allow cookies or remove existing cookies.</p>

                <h4>Mozilla Firefox</h4>
                <p>Go to Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data. You can choose to delete cookies when Firefox closes or keep them until they expire.</p>

                <h4>Safari</h4>
                <p>Go to Preferences > Privacy > Cookies and website data. You can then choose to block all cookies, block third-party cookies, or allow all cookies.</p>

                <h4>Microsoft Edge</h4>
                <p>Go to Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Manage and delete cookies and site data. You can choose to allow or block all cookies, or just third-party cookies.</p>

                <h3>6.2 Consequences of Disabling Cookies</h3>

                <h3>7.1 Web Beacons</h3>
                <p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
